    "This exercise is supposed to be very easy, does not give any points, and is voluntary. There will be a similar exercise on every sheet. It is intended to revise some basic mathematical notions that are assumed throughout this class and to allow you to check if you are comfortable with them. Usually you should have no problem to answer these questions offhand, but if you feel unsure, this is a good time to look them up again. You are always welcome to discuss questions with the tutors or in the practice session. Also, if you have a (math) topic you would like to recap, please let us know."

In pattern recognition we try to find underlying structure which is unique in data. In the case of high dimensionality it is more likely that data vectors are orthogonal to each other and have similar distances. This makes it difficult to find meaningful structure in the data. \n",

This manifold has dimensionalty much lower than the dimension of the whole vector space. By finding a representative coordinate system for the manifold one can project the data to the new coordinate system.

To be more precise, we show that the orthonormal projection onto an $m$-dimensional subspace that maximizes the variance of the projected data is defined by the principal components, i.e. by the $m$ eigenvectors of the autocorrelation matrix $C$ corresponding to the $m$ largest eigenvalues.
